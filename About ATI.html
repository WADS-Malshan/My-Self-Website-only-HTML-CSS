        <h2>Advanced Technical Education (ATI)</h2>
        <p>
            As per the recommendations of the Committee
            appointed by Prof. Wiswa Waranapala, Deputy Minister of
            Higher Education in 1994, the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced
            Technical Education (SLIATE) was formed in 1995, under the Sri Lanka
            Institute of Advanced Technical Education Act No. 29 of 1995, In 2001 the
            name of the institution was amended as Sri Lanka Institute of
            Advanced Technological Education, (SLIATE). It functions as an
            autonomous Institute for the management of Higher National and National
            Diploma courses. The main purposes of establishing SLIATE were
            to reform and restructure the entire technical and vocational education
            system in relation to the changing needs of economic development, to meet
            manpower requirements of national development strategies, and the promotion
            of privatization, With special concern of meeting the scarcity of trained
            technological manpower resources at the technician level.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SLIATE is a statutory body operating under
            the purview of the Ministry of Higher Education and is
            one of the leading higher educational institutions in Srilanka.
