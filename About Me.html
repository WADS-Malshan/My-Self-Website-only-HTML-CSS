        <h2>My Self</h2>
        <p>
            Hi... I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.
            My name is Naveen Tharusha Wijesiri. I am in Eabilipitiya.

            My father does a country job.  Mother doesn't have a job.
            My brother has a job and he takes good care of us.
            My school is Eabilipitiya Preasident collage.
            I have a lot of friends and some of my best friends.
            I like to be with them.  My school is the best school in my town.
            Also very big and there are a lot of kids.

            We have been involved in many sports activities at the school.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many things I like to do,
            to see, and to experience. I like to read,
            I like to write; I like to think,
            I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.
            I like to see the sunrise in the morning,
            I like to see the moonlight at night,
            I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.
            I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind,
            I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.
            I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn,
            and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late;
            I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace,
            I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful chanderika lake in eabilipitiya,
            .Ilike delicious food and comfortable shoes;
            I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature,
            I like people. And, I like to laugh
        </p>
        <p>
            I have just finished school and am studying for a
            Diploma in Tourism and Hospitality Management at the Galle
            Institute of Higher Education.
            My hope is to complete this diploma well and go abroad for work.
            I hope to visit each of the places I like very freely.
        </p>
