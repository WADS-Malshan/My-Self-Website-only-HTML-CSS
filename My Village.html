        <h2>Embilipitiya</h2>
        <img src="images/Embilipitiya01.jpg" alt="Village" width="500px" height="500px" style="float: left;">
        <p>
            My village is Eabilipitiya.
            it is very beautiful and big.
            Embilipitiya is a town, governed by an urban council,
            in Ratnapura District, Sabaragamuwa Province, Sri Lanka.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 1970s it was a small town with two or three small boutiques.
            Under the Udawalawe development project, Embilipitiya grew and currently 
            it is one of towns in Sri Lanka with a modern infrastructure.
            Embilipitiya is becoming the central hub and the commercial centre of
            Greater Hambantota development project. Embilipitiya is the nearest city
            to Sooriyawewa International Cricket Stadium and Mattala International Airport.
            The six-lane main access road to Mattala Airport comes from Embilipitiya
        </p>
        <p>
            During the 1970s transportation to and
            from Embilipitiya was difficult.
            There were two or three buses from Embilipitiya to Ratnapura and
            there was no guarantee that they would be running daily. However,
            the transportation system developed significantly. There are buses from
            Embilipitiya to Ratnapura and Colombo every five minutes and the
            Embilipitiya bus
            station is one of the busiest in Southern and Sabaragamuwa region.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before, Embilipitiya was one of the areas where there were
            poor education facilities. However, Embilipitiya eventually got
            better schools. Embilipitiya Central College is the only school
            in Sabaragamuwa and Southern Sri Lanka where there is a swimming pool.
            Newly established Embilipitiya Technical College brought new hopes to
            school leavers in the area. [ Due to the rapid development of the education
            network in the area, Embilipitiya produced highly skilled and educated people.
            Thousands of doctors, engineers, lawyers, post graduate scientists,
            university professors
            and also reputed sportsmen and sportswomen hail from Embilipitiya.
        </p>
        <p>
            Schools within Embilipitiya Urban council
            area include Embilipitiya President's College, Embilipitiya Maha
            Vidyalaya, Embilipitiya International School, Embilipitiya
            Junior Secondary School, Moraketiya Maha Vidyalaya,
            Halmillaketiya Maha Vidyalaya, and Modrawana Maha Vidyalaya.
        </p>
        <p>
            My village has branches of almost all private and public banks
            and also the town is served by number of supermarket chains.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Economic Centre[2] and the international leaders'
            training center are key institutions in my vilage.
            The recently established Embilipitya modern town hall is a
            major achievement in the area. Public and private institutes
            aim to help people engaged in the small-scale food processing
            sector to develop relevant skills and technology, and to
            increase their access to information which will contribute towards
            helping them gain control of their livelihoods and communities.
        </p>
        <p><b>The many attraction places are in  my village</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Udawalawa Elephant Orphanage</li>
            <li>Chandrika lake </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The most popular attraction place is chandrika lake in eabilipitiya.
            Chandrika Lake is a beautiful lake situated in Embilipitiya
            in the Ratnapura district. Although a bit off the radar for tourists,
            this lake is a popular attraction among the locals and the villagers.
            Villagers gather here to bathe and have a good time with family and friends.
            The lake reflects a beautiful blue colour from its water.
            Above I mentioned about my village.
            That is all the details about my village.
